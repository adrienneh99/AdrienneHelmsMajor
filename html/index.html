                <h2>HELLO & WELCOME!</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a former business professional with a proven track record of going above and beyond to improve
                    the environments I work in. Whether I'm delivering exceptional customer service or finding
                    innovative and efficient ways to get things done, I'm always up for a challenge!
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I bring a wide range of skill sets to each project, including attention to detail, organization,
                    ability to multitask, and years of successful project collaboration. I love to learn new things and
                    I'm a quick learner! Over a period of 16 weeks I taught myself Android development while building a
                    fully functional mobile app.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Drawn to the blend of creative and analytical skills required in software development, my goal is
                    to better the world through coding. I'm dedicated to making a difference and nothing motivates me
                    more than knowing that my efforts are contributing to something bigger than myself.
